# AutoML Engine
[日本語版 README はこちら](README.ja.md)

## 概要
This project is a Python-based AutoML engine designed for integration into AI applications.
It supports classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection, enabling programmatic control of model selection, preprocessing, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and explainability.

The engine is provided as a package to be imported by other applications. UI and UX are out of scope.
It also includes LLM-based interpretation and summarization of training results for downstream use.
