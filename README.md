# automl-engine
This project is a Python-based AutoML engine for integration into AI applications. It supports classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection, with programmatic control over training, evaluation, and explainability. The engine is an importable package and includes LLM-based interpretation of results. UI and UX are out of scope.
